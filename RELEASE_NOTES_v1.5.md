**Git Commit:** 4a352f4

## 🎯 What's New in Version 1.5

### Major Improvements

#### 1. Smart Chart Grouping
Charts are now organized by measure for easier analysis:
- **Before:** All X charts → All mR charts → All Distribution charts
- **After:** For each measure: X chart → mR chart → Distribution chart

**Benefits:**
- Analyze all aspects of a measure without scrolling
- More intuitive workflow
- Faster process analysis

#### 2. Accurate Signal Detection
Tooltips now show precise signal status for each data point:
- ⚠️ **Both X & mR Signaling** - Only appears on points that signal in both charts
- 📊 **X Chart Signal** - Only appears on X chart signal points
- 📈 **mR Chart Signal** - Only appears on mR chart signal points

**Benefits:**
- No more false "both signaling" badges
- Clear identification of which points are out of control
- Better decision-making for process interventions

**Fix:** Implemented point-specific signal detection  
**Impact:** Tooltips now accurately reflect which points are signaling

---

## ✅ Testing Checklist

Before deploying to your team, verify:
- [ ] Charts are grouped by measure (X, mR, Distribution together)
- [ ] Signal badges only appear on signaling points
- [ ] "Both signaling" badge only appears when both charts signal at that point
- [ ] All CSV files load correctly
- [ ] PNG export works for all chart types
- [ ] Distribution charts appear last for each measure

## 🎓 Wheeler's Methodology Clarification

This release reinforces correct SPC interpretation:

**Key Points:**
1. X chart defines phases (process location)
2. mR chart uses same phase boundaries (process variation)
3. Charts can signal independently:
   - X only = Average shifted
   - mR only = Variation changed
   - Both = Location and variation out of control

**Control Limit Behavior:**
- Limits reflect the previous stable phase
- New limits calculated for next phase after signal
- This is standard SPC practice ✓

---

## 🚦 Deployment Recommendations

### For Station Teams
- Deploy during off-peak hours
- Provide 5-minute overview of chart grouping
- Show example of accurate signal badges
- Keep old version available for 1 week as backup

### For Analysts
- Review CHANGELOG_v1.5.md for technical details
- Test with your actual data before team rollout
- Note improved workflow for multi-measure analysis
